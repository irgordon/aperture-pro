# Aperture Pro

### Professional Photography Proofing & Delivery Platform for WordPress

Aperture Pro is a modern, production‑grade WordPress plugin that transforms WordPress into a full photography proofing, delivery, and client‑communication platform. It is built with a modular architecture, background job processing, token‑secured client portals, and a premium admin UI.

This plugin is engineered for performance, reliability, and long‑term maintainability — ideal for high‑volume studios and SaaS‑style deployments.

## Architecture Overview

Aperture Pro is built using a clean, domain‑driven folder structure:

```text
src/
├─ Admin/           # Admin UI screens
├─ Client/          # Client portal shortcode + assets
├─ Core/            # Autoloader, installer, hooks, schema
├─ Domain/
│  ├─ Jobs/         # Job queue system
│  ├─ Proofing/     # Proofing workflow
│  ├─ Tokens/       # Access + download tokens
│  ├─ Delivery/     # ZIP generation + delivery state
│  └─ Project/      # Project stages
├─ Http/
│  ├─ Middleware/   # Permissions, validation, input
│  └─ Rest/         # REST API controllers
├─ Storage/         # Storage adapters + manager
└─ Support/         # Utilities (Sanitize, Enum, Error, Date, etc.)
```

**Assets:**

```text
assets/
├─ admin.css
├─ admin.js
├─ client.css
├─ client.js
└─ components.css
```

**Templates:**

```text
templates/
├─ admin/
└─ client/
```

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to:
   ```
   /wp-content/plugins/aperture-pro/
   ```

2. Activate the plugin in WordPress → Plugins.

The plugin automatically:
- Creates required database tables
- Registers REST routes
- Loads admin UI
- Enables the client portal shortcode

## Client Portal Usage

1. Create a WordPress page (for example: Client Portal).
2. Add the shortcode to the page content:
   ```
   [aperture_pro_portal]
   ```
3. Generate and email links like:
   ```
   https://your-site.com/client-portal/?token=ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

Tokens are generated automatically when a project is created or when delivery links are sent.

## Background Jobs

Aperture Pro includes a full job queue:

> queued → running → succeeded

- Automatic retries
- Dead‑letter queue
- Logging + admin viewer

Jobs are triggered via:

```php
JobScheduler::enqueue($project_id, JobTypes::ZIP_GENERATION);
```

## Storage Adapters

Aperture Pro ships with:
- **LocalStorageAdapter** (default)

The architecture supports additional adapters:
- Amazon S3
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Wasabi
- Google Cloud Storage

Adapters are managed via:

```php
StorageManager::adapter()->store($localPath, $targetPath);
```

## Extending Aperture Pro

**Add a new job type**

Implement a handler in `JobRunner` and enqueue via:

```php
JobScheduler::enqueue($project_id, 'my_custom_job', ['foo' => 'bar']);
```

**Add a new storage adapter**

Implement `StorageAdapterInterface` and register it in `StorageManager`.

**Add new REST endpoints**

Create a controller in `src/Http/Rest/` and register routes in `aperture-pro.php`.

**Add new admin tabs**

Hook into:

```php
do_action('ap_admin_project_tabs', $project_id);
```

## Development Notes

- Fully PSR‑4 autoloaded
- No global functions except helper wrappers
- All state transitions validated via middleware
- All REST responses use `Response` utility
- All errors logged via `Logger`
- All user input sanitized via `Sanitize`

## Security Model

- Clients authenticate via single‑use, expiring tokens
- Admins authenticate via WordPress capabilities
- All REST endpoints use middleware:
  - Permissions
  - Token validation
  - Project stage validation
- No sensitive data stored in browser
- No direct file access — all via storage adapter
